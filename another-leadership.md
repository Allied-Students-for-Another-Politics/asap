## Another Leadership: We Are All Leaders 

It has become a common occurrence to hear anti-authoritarian groups make the claim that their organization "has no leaders." However, this is not an accurate reflection of the internal dynamics of any group. Whether formally recognized or not, leaders will always have a presence and an ability to influence the larger group. When we claim that we have no leaders, we deny the different backgrounds and experiences we come from, and the skills that these experiences have allowed us to cultivate.  

The desire for leaderless groups is understandable; as a culture, we tend to associate leadership and leadership skills with patriarchal, authoritarian characteristics, such as aggressiveness, assertiveness, self-assuredness, and a willingness to dominate. As a result, our common conception of leadership is leadership by domination and oppression. Although these qualities are not necessarily oppressive in and of themselves, we must not constrain our visions of leadership to this alone. In doing so, we would fail to recognize a wide variety of qualities and skills vital to building social change and empowerment.

In his book, Chris Dixon presented a concept of leadership that is becoming more popular in the anti-authoritarian current, one that takes into account often-unrecognized forms of leadership. Dixon calls this "another leadership." As an anti-authoritarian group, Allied Students for Another Politics seeks to implement a model of "another leadership" within our organization. We do this by seeking consensus before making decisions, offering skill shares, leadership opportunities and guidance, workshops, and support systems which serve to emphasize not individual leaders, but a collective leadership. We strive to foster leadership skills in those less experienced or less confident in their capabilities, and our consensus process helps ensure that everyone has a voice, whether dissenting or otherwise. 

This project seeks to redefine leadership so that we will not claim "we have no leaders," but instead that "we are all leaders!"
