Within the anti-authoritarian current, horizontalidad is a favorite method for internally structuring groups and organizations. It is a style born out of the popular Argentinian worker’s struggles of 2003, and draws on the fundamentals of Marxism, anarchism and participatory democracy; the word horizontalidad itself translates literally into “horizontality”. A horizontally-organized group does not have official leaders (such as presidents, treasurers, etc.), but instead places the same amount of formal power and decision-making ability into the hands of everyone in the group. In contrast to a vertical (or “top-down”) structure, where power and decision-making is concentrated at the top, practitioners of horizontalidad seek to distribute power between everybody involved. You can imagine horizontalidad as everybody standing on the same level, hence “horizontal.”

There are many reasons why a group might decide to structure themselves horizontally. To get an idea of why horizontalidad might be appealing (or why vertical organization is unappealing), imagine you work at a chain restaurant (which many students do). Said restaurant would have a corporate office, likely somewhere far away from where you actually work. In that office there would be GMs and CEOs, people that you might have sparse contact with, assuming you work at a relatively small chain. In a larger corporation, you’d probably have never spoken to, seen, or even thought about the possibility of encountering your corporate overlords.

Even though these individuals have little to no relationship with you or your co-workers, and they probably don't even live in the same town as you, they get to call all of the shots; they decide what goes on the menu, the ingredients used, who your immediate boss will be, who you associate with, who’s hired, who’s fired, your working conditions, your  wage, and so on. They have all kinds of power over your work, and you get no say whatsoever, despite being highly involved in and familiar with the restaurant’s daily operations.

Basically, this is the predicament of vertical organization: the people in the greatest position to make appropriate decisions (the workers) lack the power, while the people calling the shots couldn’t be any further removed from the real consequences of their decisions. Practitioners of horizontalidad are inclined to believe that the people working in this restaurant every day should have more autonomy and a greater power to make decisions to improve their workplace.
