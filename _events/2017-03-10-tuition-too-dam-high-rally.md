If the increasing cost of tuition is important to you, come listen, let your voice be heard, and join a plan to act before the Board votes to raise tuition on the 17th. Students may not have fair representation on OSU's Board, but we do have the power of collective action and organizing. With the vote little more than one week away, it's critical that we come together to act against the Board's proposed tuition increase.

As tuition at OSU has risen 79% over the last 9 years--with another increase planned for next year--it is becoming increasingly clear that the administration is not committed to understanding (or not interested in knowing) what students are going through in order to finish. Â¡Ya basta! If the administration doesn't want to hear, it's up to us to have a conversation that can't be ignored. On March 10th--one week before the Board votes to increase tuition once again--join us for a conversation about what rising tuition means for students here at OSU and what we, the student body, can do to stop it.
