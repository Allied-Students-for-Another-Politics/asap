**Date:** March 13

**Time:** 12 PM - 1:30 PM

**Location:** Memorial Union 211 American Indian Room

**Affiliated with:** Allied Students for Another Politics (ASAP!)

Amid increasing student debt and rising tuition costs, notions of what universities can be are often constrained by the imposition of capitalist logics. Fern Thompsett, a PhD student at McGill University and co-founder of Brisbane Free University, will speak on the value and possibility of free universities and their prospects for an emancipatory future.

Sponsored by Allied Students for Another Politics, Students United for Palestinian Equal Rights (SUPER), Anarres Project for Alternative Futures, and the Alliance for a Socially Just University.

This event is free and open to the public.
