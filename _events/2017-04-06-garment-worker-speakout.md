### {{ page.title }}

**Date:** April 6 

**Time:** 7 PM - 9 PM

**Location:** LINC 302

**Affiliated with:** Sweatshop Free OSU

United Students Against Sweatshops is conducting a nationwide “Nike: Just Do the Right Thing” speaking tour featuring Sophorn Yang, a Cambodian garment worker and former union President who will talk about the hardships she experienced producing apparel for brands like Nike, and the need for independent factory monitoring.

This event is the latest in USAS’s campaign to get Ed Ray to affiliate with the Worker Rights Consortium, an independent labor watchdog organization, to access and inspect garment factories around the world. Let’s make sure our University takes a stand for workers who make our Beavers apparel!

This speaking tour event will be an incredibly powerful and rare opportunity for students and faculty to speak directly with a worker who can talk about the harsh realities of producing University apparel abroad, and how students can help with their struggle for justice. We hope to see you there!
