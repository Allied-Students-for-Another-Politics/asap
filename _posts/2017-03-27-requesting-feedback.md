### Help Direct the New Site!

*March 29th, 2017*

This is the first iteration of ASAP's new website. My initial goal was to get a simple working copy ready to go, so that's what this is. The current content, design, and layout is just for the sake of having something to show you all while we decide on these details collaboratively. Hopefully when we're through the site will look very different!

#### What We Have Now

At the moment, there isn't much to see. The content of the site is mostly the same as [ASAP's current site](http://asapolitics.wixsite.com/asap) (which I copy-pasted from). We will have the opportunity to revise, add, or remove whatever we see fit, but I figured it makes sense to start with what we already have. Some of the pages (like Social Media, Meeting Notes, and Connect) have been omitted for the time being. 

The layout consists of the "Allied Students for Another Politics!" header, the navigation bar, and the page's content. The Announcements and Events pages are kind of bloggy in the sense that they are a series of posts (either announcements or upcoming events). I've put some example announcements and events in each (this post is one of them), but I've got a lot more work to do in that realm.

#### Design Decisions

I don't have any eye for design, and I'm not very interested in being the person deciding what ASAP's site should actually look like. Ideally, I want all of you to do that. If anyone's up to the task, or feeling creative, it would be amazing to have some mock-up designs exploring what the site could look like. (Could be a sketch, image, or whatever you want to do.) 

Take this opportunity to share your opinions about what you want the website to be. I've created [a document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jgg-BT3DhPqijJp0E-L65VAFls3PijMJofVVJLKy-Tw/edit?usp=sharing) where we can take note of anything and everything pertaining to making it better, so please take a look and leave your feedback. When we have a clearer direction for the site I'll do my best to implement the desired changes.

#### Text Content

As you can see, most of the text content comes from ASAP's current site. To give everyone the opportunity to weigh in on the new site's content, I've created [another document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bq60TeHQGWRrmv0SNirdu6h8hTp4y9Lm85vkoVTg1fs/edit?usp=sharing) listing each page's text. Please read over it and make any changes or suggestions as desired. I tried to get the ball rolling.
