## Facilitation 101

ASAP! is not the first OSU student organization to employ consensus, and owes a lot to previous groups that have experimented with consensus and left documents behind for groups like ASAP! to utilize. In recognition of the work that organizers have done before us, ASAP! provides below a guidesheet for first time facilitators looking for tips and preparation for what to expect when facilitating. This document was created in the early 2000s by the horizontalist group Wrench; we and all of those who use this document owe a great deal of gratitude to those activists in Wrench that took the time and consideration to leave lasting memories of their work behind for future organizers.
