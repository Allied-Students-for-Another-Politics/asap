## Facilitation 101

ASAP is committed to a consensus decision-making process, and a chief component of that process is having two co-facilitators for every meeting. Facilitators should be people who understand the core principles of facilitation and recognize that to facilitate is not to lead a meeting, but to help guide a meeting through its process.

ASAP is not the first OSU student organization to employ consensus, and we owe a lot to previous groups that have experimented with consensus and left documents behind for groups like ASAP to utilize. In recognition of the work that organizers have done before us, we provide below a guidesheet for first time facilitators looking for tips and preparation for what to expect when facilitating. This document was created in the early 2000s by the horizontalist group Wrench; we, and all who use this document, owe a great deal of gratitude to those activists in Wrench that took the time and consideration to leave lasting memories of their work behind for future organizers.
