## About ASAP
We are a group of student organizers who recognize that "change starts at the bottom through the countless small actions of unknown people." (Howard Zinn) We position ourselves against all systems of oppression including white supremacy, capitalism, patriarchy, heterosexism, colonialism, and fascism. Guided by principles of inclusivity and committed to consensus decision-making, we aim to foster the empowerment and autonomy of student and community populations through means of direct action. We hope to align our projects with other like-minded organizations and people with the spirit of solidarity.

What is Another Politics? Inspired by the extensive documentary work of Oregon State University alum and activist, Chris Dixon, we believe as a group that we belong to the current spirit of popular anti-oppression movements in the U.S. that Dixon has categorized as “Another Politics,” which he details as having four core principles as follows:

1. Struggling against all forms of domination, exploitation, and oppression.
2. Developing new social relations and forms of social organization in the process of struggle.
3. Linking struggles for improvements in the lives of ordinary people to long-term transformative visions.
4. Organizing that is grassroots and bottom-up.

In addition, Another Politics is informed by the movement traditions and ideas of anti-racist feminism, anarchism, and prison abolitionism. These currents, according to Chris Dixon, weave together a form of anti-authoritarian politics which point towards a different conception of politics altogether: Another Politics.
