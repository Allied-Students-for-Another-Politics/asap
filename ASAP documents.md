4. Click on the Members icon

# Space and Rooms in the Memorial Union (includes the MU Quad and SEC Plaza)
 
1. Go to http://mu.oregonstate.edu/reservations/makereservation
2. If you have not registered click the register as a new user and complete the prompts
3. From the above link click the Make a Reservation icon
4. Login with your name and password
5. Scroll to the tab at the top and click on where it says Reservations
6. From here you will see options to reserve Advertising Space (which includes MU Tv’s, table tops, large posters on the MU steps, etc) Quad/SEC Plaza Space, and MU rooms for events. Click on the respective link for what you want to reserve.
7. Plug in the dates/times you want to reserve space. For Quad/SEC Plaza you need a full 24 hours in advance to reserve, for Advertising space 5 days, and for MU event rooms 5 days. 
8. Once you find a time and space, you can highlight the space you want and press the + sign to begin the reservation, from here you will be prompted to fill out all the remaining details about the reservation including a title for the event, contact info, and any equipment that you want to use. We have full discounts on rooms and equipment except for amplification, projectors, and the Ballroom has a cost for labor. 
 
 
# Space and Rooms Other than MU
1. Each term, a group member must request a Course Reserve Number (CRN). Email the Schedule Desk at schedule@oregonstate.edu (in the email, simply say you are a Lead Officer for ASAP and are requesting a CRN for the term). Important! The Schedule Desk prefers to have One contact person from ASAP send them emails requesting a CRN, this has been me in the past so they expect requests from me. One person will have to be appointed the contact person for this specific task- once ASAP has a CRN anyone can then use the number for making reservations. 
2. Once you reserve a CRN, you can make room reservations at this url http://sli.oregonstate.edu/orgs/spacereservations
3. From this page, scroll down to General Purpose Classrooms and click on the highlighted link to use the Webviewer. 
4. From this page, click on the link for the Webviewer again. 
5. This page allows you to pick a date and see what rooms are available at specific times. Locate a time slot, which is organized on the left by University Building and Room number with time slots across the top, and click on the time you want. 
6. From here, plug in the requested information. Where it says “If Student Group, what office do you hold in the group?” always put “Lead Officer.” 
7. You will see the place to use our CRN and then after submitting it usually takes two days for confirmation. 
 
# Adding Emails to our Riseup listserv 
(asap-insider-email@lists.riseup.net)
### Adding Admins: 
Our current list of admins to the listserv, which allows one to upload documents, add emails, and a whole bunch of stuff, is: Isamar, Azeem, Justin, Eloise, Andrew, Kali, Travis, and me. I added a lot of people to be admins, but got too lazy to keep going, so these folks can pick up the slack and add more ASAP admins to make managing this listserv easier. 
1. You will need to register your email, then login to riseup here https://lists.riseup.net/www/
2. From this page, you will see all the listservs through riseup you subscribe to on the left. Click on asap’s. 
3. To add an admin, those with admin privileges, go to the link on the left that says “Admin”
4. From here click on “Edit List Config.”
5. From here click on “List Definition” Once you click on this page you will see a list of owners with their info, and under the Owners lists you will want to add folks to make them admins (so Owners are Admins). You will always have one additional box to input new names into, and once you do that you have to scroll to the bottom of the page and click Update in order to have another empty box for adding more people. So you can only add one at a time, which is annoying, but that’s how it works. There is also a list of Moderators, which Sam is currently the only one, and you can add folks there too but I’m not sure what additional things moderators can do- it seems like nothing that an Owner can’t. 
### Adding Emails: 
1. From ASAP main page, click “Review Members”. Here you will see the whole list of emails, purge the untrusty, and add new members here. You will also see what emails are bouncing (always Azeem’s) and can fix that. 
2. Where it says “Add a new user” is where you put the person’s email address, and click Add. If you want multiple new emails at once, first click the Multiple Add link to the right and from there it’s easy. 
3. Additional Features: This listserv page is also where you can add big files to share through the listserv without it being rejected. Click on Shared Documents, then click on Expert Mode if you want to add a folder or upload a file. Only Admins can do this, so the more admins the merrier. Once you have uploaded a file, click on the link that shows it and from there copy and paste the url of the file into an email sent out to the group. This shared documents folder could probably be utilized well as a good organizing tool for ASAP. 
4. You can also share big files by going to share.riseup.net, and uploading a file here. Once uploaded, copy the url and paste into an email for the group. The difference here is that any file you upload this way will automatically expire after 7 days- this method is made for encrypting files and security which is why things automatically expire. 
 
# Adding Emails to General Email List 
(alliedstudentsforanotherpolitics@googlegroups.com or notforcebutpersistence@googlegroups.com these are actually the same list, don’t know why the old name still works but it does and sends to the current asap name)
1. Go to groups.google.com
2. Click on the link My Groups
3. Click on ASAP group. 
4. In the right-hand corner you will see a tab for Members, click this. 
5. From here, click on the tab Manage. 
6. On the left, you will see the option to Direct Add Members, click this. 
7. From here, you can add five emails at a time by separating the emails with a comma, and have a nice welcoming message for folks. 
8. On this listserv you can also generate posts that go out to all subscribers, or you can simply send emails to the address alliedstudentsforanotherpolitics@googlegroups.com from your own email.
9. I think anyone that is already a member of this list can add new folks, since I’m not the moderator or owner of the list myself but can do this, but if there are any problems let me know and we’ll see if we can figure this out. 
10. This is a list for general announcements, like events and meetings, and should not be used for internal group messaging. Only add emails of folks that haven’t committed yet to being an ASAPista.
