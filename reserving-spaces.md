# Reserving Spaces & Rooms

These instructions explain how to reserve spaces on-campus (including rooms, the SEC Plaza, and the MU Quad). They require that you are registered as an officer in the Student Leadership & Involvement (SLI) system by an existing officer. Follow the appropriate section depending on whether the location belongs to the Memorial Union (MU) or somewhere else.

## Registering an Officer in SLI

Only an existing officer is capable of registering other officers. Ask someone in ASAP who's already registered to follow these instructions for you:

1. Go to <http://apps.ideal-logic.com/osusli>
2. Login with your Canvas username and password.
3. You will see options to register members and register events. Click on the Members icon.
4. Underneath the Officers tab, click on “Add/Update Officers”
5. Always register new members as an officer, and give them "Lead Officer" status so they can do anything paperwork-related for the group.
6. Click on "Select a Person"
7. Towards the bottom of the page, click on the + sign that says "Add a New Person"
8. Search for the name of the OSU student you're registering, then select their name.
9. They will be sent an automated email. After approving it, they can use their account.

## Spaces in Memorial Union, MU Quad, SEC Plaza

Note that you will need an MU Reservations System account, and you cannot use a newly created account until it's been approved. If you do not already have an account created for reserving spaces at the MU, and you don't have the time to wait, contact others in ASAP who already have accounts set up.

Reservations must be placed in advance:

* **MU Quad:** 24 hours
* **SEC Plaza:** 24 hours
* **MU Event Rooms:** 5 days
* **Adverting Spaces:** 5 days

## Other Spaces

### Course Reserve Number

A Course Reserve Number (CRN) is required to place a reservation. ASAP must request a new CRN every term. Ask around to determine whether ASAP currently has a useabale CRN. If not, a new one must be requested.

The Schedule Desk prefers to have only one contact person from ASAP, so find out who has taken on this responsibility. If nobody has, you should. To request a CRN, email [schedule@oregonstate.edu](mailto://schedule@oregonstate.edu). State that you are a Lead Officer for ASAP and that you are requesting a CRN for this term.

Once ASAP has a CRN for this term, anyone can use it to place reservations.

1. Go to <http://sli.oregonstate.edu/orgs/spacereservations>

2. Scroll down to the "General Purpose Classrooms" and click on the "webviewer" link.

3. Click on the "Webviewer" link.

4. This page allows you to select a date and see which rooms are available at specific times. Time slots are organized on the left by University Building and Room number with time slots across the top. Click on a suitable timeslot.
